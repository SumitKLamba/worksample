Here are two accessible web components I developed in stencilJs with TailwindCSS
1. mb-button is a button component which has has different types and different sizes and I've tried my best to not rewrite any code and tried using variables for everything.
2. mb-icon is a icon component which uses a font family that was created with the help of Icomoon and returns icon according to the size, color and many more attributes.
